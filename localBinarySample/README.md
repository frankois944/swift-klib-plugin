Build a dummy xcframework for testing local binary import.

The xcframework should already be available in the repository and used by the tests.

If you need to update the dummy, update the code and run `./build.sh` and the framework will be generated in this folder : ../plugin/src/functionalTest/resources/DummyFramework.xcframework
